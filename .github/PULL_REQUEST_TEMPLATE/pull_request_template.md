Thank you for opening a Pull Request! Before submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:
- [ ] Make sure to open a GitHub issue as a bug/feature request before writing your code!  That way we can discuss the change, evaluate designs, and agree on the general idea.
- [ ] Ensure the tests and linter pass.
- [ ] Code coverage does not decrease (if any source code was changed).
- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary).
- [ ] I have readed the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-compose/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and added my Maps API key as a secret so the instrumentation tests can run.
